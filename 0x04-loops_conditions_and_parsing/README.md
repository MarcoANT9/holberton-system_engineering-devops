This project is focused on the bash usage in Linux Operating System.

Task 0 is associated to the file 0-RSA_public_key.pub in which is the SSH public key.

Task 1 is linked to the file 1-for_holberton_school; in this file is program to write "Holberton School" 10 times using the for loop.

Task 2 is connected to the file 2-while_holberton_school, this file is the same as the previous one, the difference is that the loop 'while' is used.

Task 3 is related to the file 3-until_holberton_school, as the previous two files, this one works with a loop, in this case, the 'until' loop is used.

Task 4 works with the file 4-if_9_say_hi, this program takes a while loop and writes "Holberton School" except when the counter reaches 9 in which case, it writes 'Hi'.

Task 5 is solved with the file 5-4_bad_luck_8_is_your_chance, like the previous file, this one works with a loop, but when the number is four it writes "bad luck", when it reaches eigth it writes "good luck", otherwise it writes "Holberton School".

Task 6 solution is located in the file 6-superstitious_numbers, it is pretty similar to the previous task, it expands the loop to 20 iterations and changes the "bad luck" output to include the place in wich the respective number is cosidered unfortunate.

Task 7 behaves like a clock according to the file 7-clock, it's just a plain 'ol clock.

Task 8 displays the content of the current directory in a list format where only the name of the files are present, it follows intructions form the file 8-for_ls.

Task 9 supports in the file 9-to_file_or_not_to_file, it checks the current directory to verify that a file or directory exist, is or not empty and if its or not a regular file.

Finally, Task 10 is a retake in the FizzBuzz task from previous proyects, it prints "FizzBuzz" when the number is a multiple of 3 and 5, "Fizz" when is only multiple of 3, "Buzz" when only of 5 and the number of the current iteration if it's not multiple of wither 3 or 5. The file is called 10-fizzbuzz.
