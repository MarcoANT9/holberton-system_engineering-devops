# 0x13. FIREWALL

This project is about firewalls and their implementation in custom web servers.

## TASKS:

#### Task 0:
Pick one answer for every question.

What is a firewall?

    1. A hardware security system
    2. A hardware or software security system
    3. A software security system

What are the 2 types of firewall:

    1. Soft and hard firewall
    2. Incoming and outgoing firewall
    3. Network and host-based firewall

What is the main function of a firewall?

    1. To filter incoming and outgoing network traffic
    2. To filter incoming and outgoing TCP traffic
    3. To filter outgoing traffic

#### Task 1:
Let’s install the ufw firewall and setup a few rules on web-01.

Requirements:

    The requirements below must be applied to web-01 (feel free to do it on lb-01 and web-02, but it won’t be checked)
    Configure ufw so that it blocks all incoming traffic, except the following TCP ports:
        22 (SSH)
        443 (HTTPS SSL)
        80 (HTTP)
    Share the ufw commands that you used in your answer file
